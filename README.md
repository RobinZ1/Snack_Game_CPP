# Snack_Game_CPP

 CapStone_SnakeGame:  Revive the classical snake game with stunning new features. Intense and exciting game play experience is ensured. All in c++ The project is built with nothing else but free_public preset framework provided by (formal game developer & youtuber(ChiliTomatoNoodles)), thanks for his contribution so I can implement a series of new features to the game base on his framework.
 
 # Features(Enhanced Graphics, Random spawning obstacles, speed changes, snake movement speed progress as time goes and more)
 
  # Important:
 # Considering the large size of files pack as running environment package .vs and .git is now over 1GB, if you want to test the game, just clone the only zip file to your local repository! Please ignore all other files!
 
 
 
 
 
 # Development Journey Summary:
 
 The framework provided by Udacity, which (code resources)comes from stackexchange, is a good option to start this project. But After doing lots of research, I find a better and more powerful framework by ChiliTomatoNoodle(a formal game developmer, 15yr+ experience)which enables me to add more feature to this game.
 
 This project took me 36h+ to research and learn all the relevant fundamental CPP game development skills.(creating windows, interactions with keyboard inputs and mouse, pixelImage, Object oriented programming in game devs...)
 Then, it took me extra 7.5 hours to actually implement this snake game project from scratch.  I created and implement the following files from scratch: 
 # snake.h/cpp, goal.h/cpp, Board.h/cpp, Location.h and then, I implemented the elements and functions needed for game to run in the Game.h/cpp file. 
 I leart a lot of practical CPP game development skills through countless debugging and experimenting, which was an exhuasting but definitely enjoyable experience. 

 # All other files such as SpriteCodex.h/cpp(pixelImage), Mouse.h, graphics.h/cpp...etc are framework files. The major part of these framework files are contributed by youtuber named: ChiliTomatoNoodles. His reserves all copyright on framework construction.
 
 For Rubric, except for concurrent part, all other specifications should have met, if not, I am willing to try my best to fix these errors and continue experimenting the new way of implementing the game. Hopefuly, with your(Dear Reviewer) guidance.
 I realize that CPP game development is such a long journey that putting more 42 hours is like barely started, it will take me another 1000 hours to be profficient at CPP game development and I am willing to gather all the decent study resources, stepping onto the shoulder of some great persons in relevant field and community and carry on my journey of CPP Game Devs.
